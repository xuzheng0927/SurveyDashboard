"Q8":"Implementing a forum as opposed to a chat room would have been much more organized and useful. This way I can either use a search feature to search for threads with a keyword or I could manually search through the forum myself to look at topics that were of interest to me as well. The chat room was very disorganized, and you have to look at it everyday to truly get anything out of it, even if you don't have any questions at that time! I even had one professor that became short with me because I asked her a question after class and she told me that 'If I had read the forum, I would know' without even bothering to answer my question. While this may be true, reading the forum is not part of my course requirements and I shouldn't have to shuffle through that absolute mess of a system in order for a simple question of mine to be answered. I was appalled by the way I was treated and I think having a forum to look though would make comments like that from terrible teachers more reasonable in the future.",

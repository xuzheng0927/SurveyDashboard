However, since I have a full course load, there are days where it is inevitable that I am going to miss readings.

I feel lectures would be alot more helpful and engaging if the lectures were taught, more like the videos on the connex website, where he shows us a code and a problem and he slowly walks us through the process of solving a problem. Many of the first year students that i know failed the exam, while the experienced students were able to get higher scores on the midterm. This different approach to teaching is only useful to the students who know it. The students who know it, still know it and the the students who are struggling, are failing.	,	More than half the time	,	Always or nearly always	,	About right	,	Very patient and is very helpful with answering questions	,	Longer lectures on how to actually go through and solve a code

Then depending on how well a student did, the prof could ask the student (through email?) if they wanted to go over the concept any more. it could be done in groups as well to save time.

I prefer the normal classroom approach as it maximizes what i can learn  from the prof,who I am paying to learn from.	,	Always or nearly always	,	Always or nearly always	,	A bit too slow	,		,	Provide a more normal approach option for those who don't  agree with the flipped class.  Perhaps lecture notes or something else along those lines.
